Dosa Recipe

Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Do keep the flame on low to low-medium flame, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. For a low fat option, just make the dosa without any oil . Now take a ladle full of the dosa batter. Pour the batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards .  Cook the dosa on a low to medium flame. Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness. You can even cover the dosa with a lid and let it get cooked from the base . When you see the batter on the top cooked, then sprinkle ¼ to ½ tsp oil on the edges and center . With the spoon spread the oil on the dosa . Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp . The base will leave the pan when its gets cooked . Fold the dosa . Serve the Dosa hot with coconut chutney, potato masala and sambar. It is best to serve this crispy dosa hot.
